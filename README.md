<h2>What is Pinterest?</h2>
<p>Pinterest is a visual discovery engine for finding ideas like recipes, home and style inspiration, and more. With billions of Pins on Pinterest, you'll always find ideas to spark inspiration. When you discover Pins you love, save them to boards to keep your ideas organized and easy to find.</p>
<h2>Why is Pinterest a good website?
</h2>
<p>Compared to other social media platforms, Pinterest yields big results with minimal time invested. It takes far less time to plan pins for the month than it does Instagram posts. For Instagram, I spend so much time thinking through my caption and for unique ways to relate to my audience.</p>
<h2>What is Pinterest primarily used for?
</h2>
<p>Pinterest is a visual bookmarking tool that helps you discover and save creative ideas. You can pin (save) images (and a short description) from any website onto boards. You can also repin (save) images from Pinterest onto boards.</p>
